# First React App 

There's a demo app, which is developed by React.js (hooks),
and Bootstrap for styling.

It's just simply an address book(created via a table), where you can add and delete users and watch existing ones.

Moreover, there's the ability to sort the user's table by any parameters.

P.S. I'm an experienced developer in Vue, but in React this's my first experience ;)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
